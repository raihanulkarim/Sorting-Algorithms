# Sorting-Algorithms
1. Selection Sort:
   - Given an unsorted array of integer values, selection sort visits each element of the array
   - As it visits an element, it employs a second index to scan the array from the present location to the end while it identifies the least (smallest) value in that segment of 		the array
   - It then swaps that least value with the current value.
   - Because one index scans the array once while another index scans part of the array each time, this sort algorithm is O(n2).
